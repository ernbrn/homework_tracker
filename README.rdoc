Homework Tracker!

Login via the home page, or create a new user if needed.

After that, start assigning some homework! Choose who you'd like to assign homework to (feel free to create a new user).

Some notes:
* Due date must be after the current date (assignment date will be automagically generated)
*Any assignments that are past due AND not marked as complete will turn red.
